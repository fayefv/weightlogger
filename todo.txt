TODO

1) fix weight ValueError exception  - done
display an error message
append only when fixed to a float value

2) single quit closes all windows including graph - done
- can manage this by plotting graph in GUI view

3) fill entry box with record for a date, if it exists


Next step is to clean up inefficient code and document properly
    part of which is binding the submit func to the plot button also for intuitive use
Proper class design and package hierarchy
    incl MVC
Also useful to include statistics report under buttons such as differential, weekly average, BMI
diet recommendations for daily calorie consumption

Also different view modes such as weekly or all-time

Please advise on button handler where you pass references to the button, the window, etc
Seems brittle
And it seems like there's a more robust way to handle events with def def and event binding
